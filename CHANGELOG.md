# Changelog

All notable changes to the QubeTX Landing Page project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.2.1] - 2025-12-05

### Added
- Committed `.claude/` configuration directory for shared Claude Code settings

### Changed
- Added `next-env.d.ts` to `.gitignore` (auto-generated by Next.js, should not be tracked)

## [2.2.0] - 2025-12-05

### Added
- New `/wallpaper` route serving an interactive animated wallpaper page
- `WallpaperMatrix` component: a tuned variant of `DotMatrix` with lower opacity (0.2), slower animation, and smoother mouse interaction optimized for 16:9 displays
- `animate-pulse-slow` animation class for subtle glow effects (4s ease-in-out cycle)
- Centered QubeTX logo with radial glow effect and "A Department of ES Dev LLC" tagline

### Changed
- Grid configuration for wallpaper uses 60×35 dots with 0.6 spacing for widescreen optimization
- Separated `viewport` export from `metadata` in wallpaper page per Next.js 16 best practices

## [2.1.8] - 2025-11-19

### Fixed
- Anchored the custom cursor to the viewport origin so its glow, ring, and dot now track the real pointer instead of sitting ~200px offset and blocking interactive elements.

## [2.1.7] - 2025-11-19

### Added
- Project-wide `.gitignore` covering Next.js build output, caches, and dependency directories so only source files land in version control.

### Fixed
- Removed the committed `node_modules/` tree (including the 120MB `@next/swc` binary) plus other generated artifacts so pushes stay under GitHub's 100MB file limit.

## [2.1.6] - 2025-11-19

### Added
- ESLint devDependencies and a working `npm run lint` script that runs the full TypeScript/React rule set.
- Updated CODEX_PROJECT.md and AGENTS.md with the current Next.js App Router workflow and workspace tree.

### Changed
- Replaced the legacy Vite node_modules with the correct Next.js dependency graph and regenerated `package-lock.json`.
- Cleaned up dot-matrix and UI components to use `import type`/JSX-safe props so the stricter linting passes without `@ts-nocheck`.
 
### Fixed
- Set `turbopack.root` inside `next.config.mjs` so Next.js no longer climbs to `/Users/realemmetts` when multiple lockfiles exist, restoring local dev/build commands.

## [2.1.5] - 2025-11-19

### Fixed
- Restored the Features section build by importing the missing `FC` type so TypeScript compilation succeeds
- Typed Hero motion variants so Framer Motion accepts the spring transition during TypeScript checks
- Imported the missing `FC` type in the Projects section to keep TypeScript builds passing

## [2.1.4] - 2025-09-27

### Added
- ESLint configuration with React and TypeScript rules plus an `npm run lint` script for local checks

### Changed
- Updated components to use `import type` for React typings and satisfied new lint expectations
- Escaped apostrophes in contact messaging to comply with JSX accessibility linting

## [2.1.3] - 2025-09-26

### Changed

## [2.1.1] - 2025-09-26

### Changed
